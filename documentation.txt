1. added script src=main.js at bottom (to prevent page delays when loading - js file must be completely loaded before rest of html doc loads)
2. used jquery $().animate function and scrollTop for smooth scrolling



Todo:
1. clean css file
2. add interactive elements? (or will it be distracting)
3. remove gihub link (or make a better github)
4. add scroll between sections
